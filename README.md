This repository is for the source code and data used in ICII 2018 paper "4G Network for Air-ground Data Transimission: A Drone based Experiment".

### Client Folder

The folder contains the Android source code of the client software used in my experiment. You need to download an Android Studio to compile it to a cell phone.

PS: you can edit the IP address in the source code to start your own demo.

### Server Folder

The python script running in the server is contained in this folder. You can implement the script in a cloud server.

**Mongodb is required in the server**

### Data Folder

This folder contains collected data in my experiment. Some data-processing scripts in python are also provided.
